A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This project was started with some friends together in a call, playing League Of Legends in the middle of the night. The idea came to make a discord bot to help spice up the server and I took the initiative to build one. This is an all purpose bot that you can use for your hearts content.

Here's why you should help develop:

    * The bot can get bigger if its more than just a one man army
    * It is a great resume builder

Of course, you do not need to contribute if you dont want to. This is just a passion project I took on after all!

Use the README.md to get started.
